"""A private discrete-event scheduler for FlowSim's customer and server processes.

The scheduler keeps a heap of (time, priority, sequence, event) entries and
processes the smallest entry first. Events at equal times run in priority order,
and events with equal priority run in the order they were queued (not the order
they were created). A process is a generator that yields events and resumes
when each event is processed. These rules follow the SimPy 4.1.2 scheduler that
FlowSim used earlier, and the scheduler was checked against SimPy 4.1.2 at commit
32e96d3.
